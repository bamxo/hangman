# file: hangman.py is a program that imitates the game Hangman. The user will have to guess a word, letter by letter, until they've run out of failed attempts
# input: The first input is a file cd "dictionary.txt" which is a text document filled with words that will be converted into a sorted dictionary. The other input is the user being first prompted to input their preferred word size and amount of lives and if they choose an invalid input, a random size will be chosen and the default lives will be chosen. Then the user will be prompted to input a single letter at a time to guess the unknown word. If an invalid letter is inputted, then the user will be asked to input another letter. Whether the user guesses the word write or runs out of lives the game will end, and the user will be prompted if they would like to play again.
# output: The output of the program greets the user to the game: Hangman, then prompts the user to input their preferred word size and amount of lives. Then the program will output the amount of lives the user inputted and the word size. If the word size input is invalid, then the program will output that the word size will be set to a random number. And if the lives input is invalid, then the program will output the default amount of lives. The program will then output the main game screen where the valid letters chosen will be displayed, underscores the represent the hidden word, along with the lives represented by a number and X's and O's. As the user is prompted to input letters, the program will output if the letter has already been chosen, if the input is invalid, if the guess is incorrect, or if the guess is correct. If the guess is incorrect, the program will output that a life has been removed. Whether the user guesses the word correctly or loses all of their lives, the program will output that the game has ended and will ask if the user if they would like to start a new game.
